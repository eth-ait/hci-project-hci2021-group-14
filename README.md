#### Alexandre Reol, Bernhard Maennel, Luca Kummer, Marco Wiedner, Nikolaos Kaliorakis, Vivian Ziemke

## Project description

    TODO

  Introduction to chosen topic in own words, possibly with a brief motivation

## Ideation

##### How might we?

- inform the user in an intuitive way on his/her electricity consumption?
- get the information to households on how to reduce the energy usage?
- make the end-user aware of their passive and "unconscious" electricity uage?
- incentivize users to invest into making their households more energy efficient?
- make users reduce their electricity consumptions by social gamification?

##### Brainstorming and Affinity Diagram
For brainstorming, we first individually tried to come up with ideas for each how-might-we-statement, and then had a meeting where we discussed / combined our ideas and then made an affinity diagram for each how-might-we-statement. You can see the results in the file hci_group_14_affinity_diagram.pdf.
