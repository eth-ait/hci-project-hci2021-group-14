# Electricity Use, Group 14
#### Alexandre Reol, Bernhard Maennel, Luca Kummer, Marco Wiedner, Nikolaos Kaliorakis, Vivian Ziemke

## Project description

Reducing electricity consumption can be a great challenge for households. The first issue that arises is that of truly becoming aware of the problem. Households might be aware of their overall electricity consumption in kWh or some other electricity-related metric but simultaneously may not really grasp what these numbers mean, how they emerge from their appliances, and what their long-run implications are. Furthermore, even if households are thoroughly informed, aware, and value the concept of energy frugality, there are many reasons that prevent them from acting. These reasons can be traced back to cognitive biases (status quo, risk aversion, social mimicry, etc) and other mechanisms that boundedly rational actors are subject to. Further reasons might be, lack of funding for energy efficient device upgrades, paralysis from many potential alternatives, and difficulties in judging better alternatives. Finally, one’s electricity usage might go far beyond what is immediately evident. For example, actions like video streaming, which lead to the consumption of energy in server farms and storage facilities are responsible for a significant amount of CO2 emissions.

The solutions that we derived, aim to tackle the problems at all the above-mentioned levels. Firstly, informing the user in an intuitive way is of utmost importance. This can be done in several ways: dashboards, visual communication of quantities, interfaces showing historic data and forecasts on the path the user has committed to, abstraction of electricity usage through a virtual pet or forest that need nurturing, delivering vital information through entertaining content, and centralized grouping and curation of relevant sources. Secondly, we believe that we can promote action through incentive schemes, gamified challenges, and innovative financing structures. Weekly challenges with friends and family could utilize the social dynamics towards lowering electricity consumption. Reward programs and virtual currencies could incentivize behavioural change, and crowdsourcing platforms could assist the ones who are in need of funding for energy upgrades. To conclude , we also had some ideas in helping with “unconscious” electricity use. Browser add-ons that analyze internet traffic and web browsing history can be used to estimate the “invisible” electricity consumed. This way, we can make the energy use of our end-users visible by creating their “digital twin”. This concept can be extended to other online actions like showing overall electricity use for the delivery of an e-shop order. By tackling the defined problems at one of these levels, we believe that we can design a platform which  can influence how people consume electricity.

## Ideation

##### How might we?

- inform the user in an intuitive way on his/her electricity consumption?
- get the information to households on how to reduce the energy usage?
- make the end-user aware of their passive and "unconscious" electricity uage?
- incentivize users to invest into making their households more energy efficient?
- make users reduce their electricity consumptions by social gamification?

##### Brainstorming and Affinity Diagram
For brainstorming, we first individually tried to come up with ideas for each how-might-we-statement, and then had a meeting where we discussed / combined our ideas and then made an affinity diagram for each how-might-we-statement. You can see the results in this file: [AffinityDiagram.pdf](/Deliverables/AffinityDiagram/AffinityDiagram.pdf)
